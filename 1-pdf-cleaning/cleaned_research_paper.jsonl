technology has been successfully implemented in regions like China India Brazil and", "in regions like China India Brazil and Turkey Therefore the success stories and achievements of these countries can be drawn in developing training programs for other countries to adopt best practices and prevent common pitfalls Also to make up for the technology gaps among regions networking and partnerships are encouraged especially in developing countries _532 Role of research institutions in disseminating knowledge about BFT_ Research institutions are centre for innovations through ground breaking", "centre for innovations through ground breaking investigations and serves to bridge the gap between scientific research and practical application The institutions help to foster spread of best practices and latest technologies in BFT by synergising with in dustry stakeholders government agencies and farmer cooperatives 11 As a key stakeholder research institutions keep farmers abreast of cuttingedge research findings by organising workshops seminars and extension services For instance the biofloc Research", "services For instance the biofloc Research and Extension Program at Universiti Malaysia Terengganu UMT Malaysia showcased the effectiveness of the effectiveness of the technology in the culture of L vannamei has been instrumental in promoting BFT adoption in Southeast Asia 3 Incorporation of workshops and field demonstra tions with participants drawn from researchers farmers and industry representatives is vital in attaining the goals of such exercise There is no gain saying that the prospects of BFT in", "is no gain saying that the prospects of BFT in aquaculture are promising When the current challenges are sufficiently addressed through tech nological advancements supportive policies and comprehensive edu cation widespread adoption is certain It is expected that the evolving technology will continue to provide more tools and knowledge to shrimp farmers with which aquaculture industry can be reshaped to meet global seafood demand while accounting for environmental impacts 6 Conclusion Shrimp aquaculture is", "impacts 6 Conclusion Shrimp aquaculture is poised to witness more sustainable operations in the wake of biofloc technology BFT has repeatedly demonstrated ability to address environmental degradation high feed cost which often leads to increased production cost and water pollution that affect con ventional shrimp aquaculture The core principle of the technology is to convert waste into nutrientrich biofloc due to interaction of beneficial microorganisms While the floc serves as nutritious food for shrimp", "the floc serves as nutritious food for shrimp the activity helps to maintain water quality in the system In addition maintenance of CN ratio promotes growth and multiplication of bene ficial heterotopic bacteria involved in assimilation of toxic nitrogenous waste and maintaining water quality Due to the high nutrient content of the biofloc reports have shown that shrimp fed with biofloc experienced improved growth rates superior health and disease resilience from improved immune system compared to", "from improved immune system compared to traditional cultured shrimps This review also reechoed the challenges hindering widescale adoption of BFT to include high initial setup costs lack alternative carbon sources which affect floc stability and quality lack of modern technology infrastructure in some regions absence of awareness leading to poor market and consumer acceptance and the need for careful management of microbial communities Nevertheless recent research advancement in countries like China Turkey", "advancement in countries like China Turkey Brazil and Israel have led to development of advanced monitoring technologies exploration of alternative carbon sources like sugarcane molasses agricultural byproducts microalgae biochar and integration with other sustainable practices have further brighten the prospects of BFT More efforts are still desired to finding suitable carbon sources per region bases knowing that agricultural products vary in variety and composition with climate and weather conditions It", "with climate and weather conditions It is important for government bodies and educational institutions to sustain research and training efforts to educate shrimp farmers on the sustainability and profitability of the technology Further research to enhance system optimization of opera tional conditions will surely promote successful implementation of BFT across the aquaculture industry CRediT authorship contribution statement Benedict Terkula Iber Writing review editing Writing orig inal draft", "Writing review editing Writing
